# Paratext TNND Views release<a id="tnnd"></a>

This additional tool for Paratext is designed to help content creators and checkers to VIEW (but not edit) the TNND Paratext Project data in different ways. There are 3 views as explained below: 

## Views

- **TNND-tag-errors** -- This aids content creators to see that there is a markup error that PT does not catch. This view may still have some false labeling.
- **TNND-word-count** - This gives a word count for each sentence.
- **TNND-hilighter** - This helps identify various character markup in the project. Useful for checkers.


## Using the TNND Views within Paratext

- If the installation was successful, the new views should be available as shown below:
	via the Ctrl+E popup menu: ![TNND control e](../images/TNND-ctrl-e.png)        <br/>or via the project's View menu:  ![TNND project views list](../images/TNND-proj-views-list.png)   
- Note that you cannot edit the text in *any* of these VIEWS - it is purely an aid for reading and checking the text (one meaning line at a time) without the clutter of markers.

- If you are using Paratext 9, then it is highly recommended to open an additional TNND window as an Autohide window:
![TNND auto hide setup](../images/TNND-auto-hide-setup.png)
- This will enable you to keep your normal workspace uncluttered, but the **TNND-tag-errrors** view or the **TNND-count-words view** will be easy to access from the right-hand column:

## There are two TNND Views controls **Tools > Custom Tools > TN Views**
