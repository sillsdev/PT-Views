# Paratext USX Views release

This additional tool for Paratext is designed to help Paratext Views developers see the underlying USX format. It does contain more than the exported USX files as Notes are overlaid.

The views come in two forms.

## Views
- **USX-column-view** -- This view shows each element on a new line.
- **USX-paragraph-view** -- This view shows each character element inline in a paragraph.
