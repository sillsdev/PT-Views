### Issue #25: 

Some wrong code that was causing \fig to be flagger by NC05, when it should not have looked at a \fig. We changed the ref to 105:1 so there are no other errors.

### Issue #26:

Moved the C02 and C03 back to TNND N27.1 and N27.2

### Issue #27:

Fixed as shown in Acts 5:20.

### Issue #28:

Acts 7:49 showing correctly now. Also copied that form into XXD 8:20.

Copied that form into XXD 8:20. (I had tried running the tag errors on all of Acts USX file. It ended up taking 25min to finish. Not an acceptable testing time.  It tells me some things are making this very slow.)

### Issue #29:

TNDD Acts 7:49 now with out report of wrong verse number.
