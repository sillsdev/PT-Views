# Xrunner scripts to build the TNND Views

This Project is setup to build the TNND-tag-errors.xslt for use in Paratext for people working on the Translatin Notes for Paratext.

It can test with various XSLT1 transformation engines. The default is Starlet but MSXML provides the more restrictive transformation that is closer to the very basic one found in Paratext.
