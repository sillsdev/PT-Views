# Paratext USX Views release<a id="usx"></a>

This additional tool for Paratext is designed to help Paratext Views developers see the underlying USX format. It does contain more than the exported USX files as Notes are overlaid.

The views come in two forms.

## Views
- **USX-column-view** -- This view shows each element on a new line.
- **USX-paragraph-view** -- This view shows each character element inline in a paragraph.

## There are two USX Views controls **Tools > Custom Tools > Custom Views** though only one will be visible at any time.
- Hide USX Views
