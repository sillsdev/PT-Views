# Paratext TNDD Views release<a id="tndd"></a>

This additional tool for Paratext is designed to help content creators and checkers to VIEW (but not edit) the TNDD Paratext Project data in different ways. There are 5 views as explained below: 

## Views

- **TNDD-table view** -- This displays up to four columns. The source language in the left most column, then the first meaning from the \ml1, then the second meaning and finally the third meaning.
- **TNDD-1st-mng-line** -- This displays the 1st meaning line preceded by the verse reference. Each verse starts on a new line.
- **TNDD-2nd-mng-line** -- This displays the 2nd meaning line and is similar to the 1st line, but if there no data for a second meaning (\ml1) line the then that data from the 1st meaning is displayed in (( )) with text in a red-brown color.
- **TNDD-3rd-mng-line** -- This displays the 3rd meaning line and is similar to the 1st and 2nd line, but if there no data for a third meaning (\ml1) line the then that data is displayed in (( with a brown color if it comes from the 2nd meaning and a red-brown if it come from he 1st first line.
- **TNDD-tag-errors** -- This aids content creators to see that there is a markup error that PT does not catch. This view may still have some false labeling.
- **TNDD-word-count-1st-mng-line** - This counts words per sentence. It marks sentence counts of more than 17 in orange and more than 30 words in tomato-red. Now includes chapter:verse and verse segment to ease comparison.
- **TNDD-word-count-2nd-mng-line** - This counts words per sentence. It marks sentence counts of more than 17 in orange and more than 30 words in tomato-red. If there is no 2nd meaning line then the 1st meaning line is included. Now includes chapter:verse and verse segment to ease comparison.
