# Paratext USX Views release

This additional tool for Paratext is designed to help Paratext Views developers see what the underlying USX format is. It does contain more than the exported USX files as Notes are overlaid.

## Views
- **USX-column-view** -- This view shows each element on a new line.
- **USX-paragraph-view** -- This view shows each character element inline in a paragraph.
